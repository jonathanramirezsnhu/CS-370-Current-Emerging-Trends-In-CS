Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The purpose of this code is to create an intelligent agent (pirate) using reinforcement algorithms to solve a maze game. The objective is to reach the end of the maze (treasure) before the human player. I was given starter code that includes the design of the treasure maze, and the code that stores the episodes, all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. I was in charge of coding the algorthim that will be used by the agent to learn to play the maze game.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Compture scientists develop the functionality of compture programs and hardware equipment. It is matters because without computer scientists, most of the currernt technology from self-driving cars to coffe machines, would not work properly or would not even work at all.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I need to consider users, the client's time and money, and the potential risks. When starting to code, I need to keep the requirements in mind at all times to make sure I do not drift off. This will save me time and save the client's time and even the user's time.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization is to deliver code that is 100% error free. I also need to keep the lives the system might affect if anything goes wrong. I need to ensure that user data is well protected from unathorized access. Finally, I need to look at the system being develop from different angles to see how it might affect me, the users, history, and society as a whole.
